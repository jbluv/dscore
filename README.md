# DeFi Score
> A methodology for assessing risk in permissionless lending platforms.

DeFi Score is a single, consistently comparable value for measuring protocol risk, based on factors including smart contract risk, collateralization, and liquidity.

We encourage the Ethereum community to evolve the methodology, making it more effective and easier to use. Have your say in the future of DeFi risk.
