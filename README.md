> DeFi Score is a methodology for assessing risk in permissionless lending platforms.

## What is it?
A single, consistently comparable value for measuring protocol risk, based on factors including smart contract risk, collateralization, and liquidity.

## Who is it for?
We encourage the Ethereum community to evolve the methodology, making it more effective and easier to use. Development will happen here on GitHub. Have your say in the future of DeFi risk.
